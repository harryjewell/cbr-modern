RATIONALE/REFLECTION
It’s fair to say that JS and other frameworks are a weak point for me, as such I was able to cobble together 
a result for this assignment that doesn’t *completely* suck.

The site is functional, with help from Ben and Jarryd I was able to piece together the foundational 
elements of the site, better understand how to interact with API’s and begin learning about how they function.

While the desired outcomes for any of my creations are almost certainly unrealistic, I knew from the beginning with this 
project that my site would inevitably look rather basic. Acknowledging my current skill level from the start 
proved to be a strong motivator for me.

I haven’t managed to get the site hosted this time around, but I’m told a GitHub repository is acceptable 
so that’s what I’m running with. I have struggled with getting sites hosted in the past as this adds an additional 
layer of complexity, however, I am still a *relatively* new user when it comes to GitHub, so learning some of the 
basics re commits, branches, forks and GitHub site/app layout has been quite beneficial for me.

I picked up a few simple CSS tricks I wasn’t previously aware of regarding grid layouts and responsiveness which was also helpful. 
My prior knowledge of how to target elements of a webpage with CSS came in handy when I first encountered the “oh I can’t change 
these html elements to suit my CSS” problem. At first this was a struggle, but once I managed to make progress, 
I had a few “EUREKA” moments, which proved to be thoroughly satisfying.

Regarding my design choices, I opted to utilise the orange/red colour from the CM logo as a highlight, I felt this provided the 
best contrast with the grey colour I used throughout the rest of the site, without looking cheap. The site will be responsive on 
devices with smaller screen sizes, which is a first for me. I think I handled the CSS portion of this assignment quite well 
considering the time constraints, and nature of interacting with an API for the first time.

I am glad to have had the opportunity to refresh and sharpen my skills in web design, learning basic GitHub and API functionality 
will be useful when tackling web design in the future.
Thanks for reading :)

# cbr-modern

This repo contains the bare-minimum you need to get started twith Vue/Nuxt.

You will see that I load the buildings and content from the home page.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [documentation](https://nuxtjs.org).

## Special Directories

You can create the following extra directories, some of which have special behaviors. Only `pages` is required; you can delete them if you don't want to use their functionality.

### `assets`

The assets directory contains your uncompiled assets such as Stylus or Sass files, images, or fonts.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/assets).

### `components`

The components directory contains your Vue.js components. Components make up the different parts of your page and can be reused and imported into your pages, layouts and even other components.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/components).

### `layouts`

Layouts are a great help when you want to change the look and feel of your Nuxt app, whether you want to include a sidebar or have distinct layouts for mobile and desktop.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/layouts).

### `pages`

This directory contains your application views and routes. Nuxt will read all the `*.vue` files inside this directory and setup Vue Router automatically.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/get-started/routing).

### `plugins`

The plugins directory contains JavaScript plugins that you want to run before instantiating the root Vue.js Application. This is the place to add Vue plugins and to inject functions or constants. Every time you need to use `Vue.use()`, you should create a file in `plugins/` and add its path to plugins in `nuxt.config.js`.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/plugins).

### `static`

This directory contains your static files. Each file inside this directory is mapped to `/`.

Example: `/static/robots.txt` is mapped as `/robots.txt`.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/static).

### `store`

This directory contains your Vuex store files. Creating a file in this directory automatically activates Vuex.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/store).

## Node version

nvm install v16.15.0
